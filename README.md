# Assignment6.1.3

- Given an integer array nums, move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

- Note that you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.

- Example 1:
	- Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,12]
	- Output: [1,3,12,0,0]
- Example 2:
	- Input: nums = [0]
	- Output: [0]

-Hints:
- To move all zeros to the end of an integer array while maintaining the relative order of non-zero elements and doing it in-place, a two-pointer approach is an efficient solution.
